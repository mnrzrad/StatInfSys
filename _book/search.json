    "text": "1.1 What is the Ethics of Data Science?\nThe ethics of data science are very important, and all data analyst, data scientists, and everyone who works with data should know the principles of ethics.\nAll individuals handling data are obligated to report any occurrences such as data theft, improper storage, unethical data collection, or data misuse.\nFor example, a business might track and store information about a customer’s path, starting from the moment they enter their email address on the website until they purchase products. In such cases, it is essential that the individual’s report remains confidential and is safeguarded it from unauthorized access.\nThe study and evaluation of ethical issues related to data have led to the emergence of a new domain in ethics, known as “data science ethics.” Data can be collected, recorded, generated, processed, shared, and used. This field also covers various data and technologies, including programming, professional code, and algorithms.\nIn the past, ethical principles in computer and information science primarily focused on the content and information present within computer systems. However, with the advancement of technology and the increasing volume of data, the scope of data science ethics has expanded to include concepts and principles related to data collection, use, processing, and sharing.\nWhen companies collect data from individuals, ethical issues related to privacy, personal information, and data misuse arise. However, when companies begin to use these data for purposes not initially specified, even more ethical concerns emerge. In other words, companies try to monetize the collected data, using it in ways that were not previously disclosed. This practice further challenges privacy, trust, and ethics in data collection and use.\nAlthough “ethics” seems complicated, it is really about understanding what is right or wrong. There are different ways people think about ethics, especially when it comes to data world.",

    "text": "Important\n\n\n\nData Ethics covers the moral and ethical obligations related to the collection, sharing, and use of data, focusing on ensuring its fair and beneficial applications. It is mainly focused on any negative impacts that data might have on individuals, groups or wider society.\n\n\n\n1.1.1 Principles of Data Ethics for Business Professionals\nIn an era where data is considered the new oil, understanding the ethical issues related to its collection, analysis, and use is of most important. Below, we will introduce the five key ethical principles that every data professional should be aware of.\n\nOwnership: The first principle of data ethics is that every individual has the right to ownership over their personal information. Just as it is considered theft to take an object without its owner’s permission, collecting someone’s personal information without their consent is both illegal and unethical. Some common methods for obtaining consent include signed written agreements, digital privacy policies that require users to agree to a company’s terms and conditions, and pop-up windows with check-boxes that allow websites to track users’ online behavior with cookies. *Never assume customers agree to their information being collected; always seek their permission to avoid ethical and legal problems.\nTransparency: In addition to ownership, individuals whose data you collect have the right to know how you plan to gather, store, and use their personal information. When collecting data, prioritize transparency and provide them with all necessary information.\nFor example, imagine your company decides to implement an algorithm to personalize the website experience based on user shopping habits and behavior. You should develop a policy explaining that cookies will track user behavior, the collected data will be stored in a secure database, and an algorithm will be trained to personalize the website experience.\nUsers have the right to access this information so they can decide whether to accept or reject your website’s cookies. Hiding or lying about your company’s methods and goals is deceptive, illegal, and unfair to the individuals whose data you handle.\nPrivacy: One of the ethical responsibilities associated with handling data is preserving the privacy of individuals whose data is involved. Even if a customer has given your company permission to collect, store, and analyze their Personally Identifiable Information (PII), it does not mean they want this information to be publicly accessible.\nPII is any data that relates to an individual’s identity. This typically includes items such as full name, address, phone number, date of birth, credit card number, bank account number, social security number, passport number, and other information that can be used to identify a person.\nTo protect individuals’ privacy, ensure you store data in a secure database to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. Data security methods that help maintain privacy include file encryption (transforming information into a readable format only with an encryption key) and dual-authentication (password protection with two-factor authentication).\nOne way to prevent errors is to de-identify the dataset. When all PII is removed, only anonymous data remains, and the dataset can no longer be traced back to individuals. This allows analysis to identify relationships between variables of interest without linking data points to personal identities.\nIntention : Before you even begin collecting data, it is crucial to consider why you need this data and what purpose you aim to achieve with it. If your intention is to engage in unethical activities, such as harassing others or improperly exploiting individuals’ vulnerabilities, then collecting their data is not ethical. Ethical data collection requires a legitimate purpose and operating in accordance with regulations and ethical principles.\nEven when your intention is good - for instance, collecting data to understand health experience in order to create an app that addresses urgent needs – you still need to evaluate your purpose for collecting every piece of data.\nOutcomes : Even if your intention and purpose in collecting and analyzing data are good, the outcome of this process might unintentionally cause harm to individuals or groups. This type of harm is known as disparate impact and is considered invalid under civil rights laws, meaning it is illegal.\nUnfortunately, you cannot definitively predict the exact impact of data analysis until it is complete. However, by considering this question and its importance before conducting the analysis, you can identify any potential disparate impacts that might occur. By being aware if the possibility of disparate impact, you can then take the necessary steps to prevent and mitigate it.",

    "text": "1.2 Why is Ethics Important in the Age of Data Abundance?\nUsing information ethically within decision-making has always been important. However, two factors have made data ethics business-critical:\n\nData Volumes : There has been an explosion in the amount of data available to organizations, both collected themselves, ans sourced from third-parties. It is not always clear where this information has come from, particularly in the case of personal information, and what permissions have been provided for its reuse.\nArtificial Intelligence : Organizations are increasing using machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to make sense of data and take automated decisions based on data analysis without involving human oversights. This can lead to issues around fairness and discrimination, even if these are unintended consequences of how data is used.\n\nThe importance of ethics in data science stems from the necessity of having a clear set of rules and guidelines that determine what businesses can and cannot do with the personal information they collect from their customers. This is crucial for safeguarding customer privacy and rights, and appropriate laws and standards must be established to protect personal information.\nAll experts agree that certain fundamental principles must be implemented, even if this field still contains gray areas and nothing is simple or uniform. These are just a few important topics and strategic ideas that have currently garnered the most attention. However, there is still much ground to cover in data ethics, and further progress and development are needed in this area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise 1\n\n\n\nIdentify the data ethics principle related to each question:\n\nIs it clear what data is being used for, how and where it is being stored, and is this information freely available to all?\nAre you collecting only data that is necessary and relevant to your clearly defined goals?\nHave you anticipated any potential harmful, negative, or biased impacts that could result from your use of the data?\nIs any personal or identifiable data being securely stored and anonymized to prevent unauthorized access?\nHave you obtained informed consent from individuals for how their data will be used in your project?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Answers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransparency\nIntention\nOutcomes\nPrivacy\nOwnership\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise 2\n\n\n\nIdentify the data ethics principle related to each question:\n\nA company collects location data from users’ mobile phones but does not disclose that this information will be shared with advertisers.\nAn analyst stores survey responses on an unsecured shared drive, and the file includes names and phone numbers of participants.\nA data science team begins using a health dataset for a study unrelated to the one participants originally agreed to take part in.\nBefore collecting any data, a team carefully evaluates whether the data they plan to gather is essential to their project goals and excludes anything not directly needed.\nBefore launching a new app feature based on user behavior data, a team conducts a risk assessment to explore how it might negatively affect vulnerable users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Answers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransparency\nPrivacy\nOwnership\nIntention\nOutcomes",

It allows you to `speak’ a graph from composable elements, instead of being limited to a predefined set of charts.\nBefore using ggplot2, a user must first install the package and then load it into their R session. Installation is done only using the command install.packages('ggplot2'). Alternatively, the following code can be used to install if only if the package is not already installed on the computer.\nwhich downloads the package from CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network). After installation, the package needs to be loaded each time R is restarted. This is done with the following command:\nA brief overview about using this package is available at this website and more complete information about how to use ggplot2 can be found in Wickham, Navarro, and Pederson (2019).\nThe structure of the package includes 7 composable parts that come together as a set of instructions on how to draw a chart.\nThe package ggplot2 requires a minimum of three main components to create a chart: data, mapping, and a layer. Other components – like scales, facets, coordinates, and themes – are optional because ggplot2 gives them automatic settings that usually work well, so you do not need to adjust them too much.\nIn the following, we briefly describe these components:\nEvery plot made with ggplot2 starts with data. This data should be in a tidy format that means the data is in a table (called a rectangular data frame) where:\nThe first step to create a plot with ggplot2 is to pass this data to the ggplot() function, which stores the data to be used later by other parts of the plot.\nFor example, if we want to make a plot using the mpg dataset, we begin like this:",

In ggplot2, an aesthetic is a visual feature of a plot like:\n\n Position (x and y) – controls where data appears on the plot\n\n Color – changes color based on data values\n\n Size – adjusts the size of points\n\n Shape – uses different shapes for different categories\n\nThese help us turn numbers into pictures.

Inside aes(), we match parts of the data (like column names) with visual elements (like \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) position).\nFor the dataset mpg, if we want to show cty (city miles per gallon) on the \\(x\\)-axis and hwy (highway miles per gallon) on the \\(y\\)-axis, we write\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

Position adjustment – controls where each part of the plot appears, especially when things overlap.\nA layer can be constructed using functions that start with geom_ (for geometry) and stat_ (for statistics). These function help us choose how the data looks and what to display.\n::: callout-note The geom_*() and stat_*() functions usually control one part of the layer – like the geometry or the statistics – but you can still manullay choose the other two parts if you want. :::\nThe code below shows how to make a scatter plot with a trend line using two layers:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

Instead of plotting each point (like in a scatter plot), it shows where points are concentrated using contour lines (geom_density_2d()) and filled contour areas (geom_density_2d_filled()).\nUse when: you have many overlapping points (overlapping) in a scatter plot and you want to highlight patterns or clusters in two numeric variables and see a smoother version of the joint distribution.\nExample\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAdding points makes it easier to see what the contours represent.\n\nggplot(faithful, aes(x = waiting, y = eruptions)) +\n  # Add Data Points for Context\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +\n  geom_density_2d()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following code results in a plot that shows filled bands of density that it is great for visual impact.\n\nggplot(faithful, aes(x = eruptions, y = waiting)) + \n  geom_density_2d_filled(alpha = 0.6) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombining points and filled contours gives both precision and overview.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can map density levels to color using ..level..\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can also different code to produce the plot.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n2.8.11 2D Binned Plot for Big Data – stat_bin2d()\nUse when: You have a lot of points and scatter plots are too dense.\nExample\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n2.8.12 Frequency Polygon – geom_freqpoly()\nA frequency plot is similar to a histogram, but it uses lines instead of bars to show how a variable is distributed. It is especially useful when you want to compare distributions across groups.\nUse when: You want to show the shape of a distribution and also compare multiple groups using lines (which may be easier to read than overlapping histograms).\nExamples\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n2.8.13 Correlation Plot (Cor plot)\nA correlation plot (or cor plot) is a visual way to show how strongly variables are related to each other. Correlation values range from \\(-1\\) to \\(1\\), and the plot helps you quickly see positive, negative, or no relationships.\nThis is not built into ggplot2, but we can use it together with\n\nThe cor() function to compute correlation\nThe corrplot or ggcorrplot package to visualize it.\n\nExample using ggcorrplot\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nExample using corrplot\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\nWickham, Hadley, Danielle Navarro, and Thomas Lin Pederson. 2019.
