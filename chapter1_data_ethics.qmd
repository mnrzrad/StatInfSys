# Data Ethics

Although "*ethics*" seems complicated, it is really about understanding what is right or wrong. There are different ways people think about ethics, especially when it comes to data world.

-   ethical theories and perspectives

-   the law and its relationship to ethics

-   some core ethical issues

### The challenge of data-driven innovation

Ethical issues and challenges are all around us. Before talking about ethics, let us review some basic things about the kinds of data-driven systems. These systems are characterized by particular things which are

-   they rely on huge amounts of data in order to function (The more and better the data, the more accurate the prediction or insight)

-   they classified as intelligent. This means that they have

    -   capacity to learn, to predict

    -   and on the basis of that learning and those predictions, make decisions

    -   and in some cases take specific action

-   they also less and less predictable to most people

How do ethical issues intersect with data science? The key takeaways?

-   the benefits and values driven from data are not evenly distributed

-   power is concentrated among a few

-   and so, the risk of harm and inequality are significant

This does not account for potential threats from malicious actors aiming to exploit or corrupt. As a result, there is growing debate on how to handle these challenges, while ensuring safety, fairness, and protecting human autonomy. These principles lie at the heart of ethics.
