# Missing Values

Missing values happen when data for an observation is not recorded. This can occur if, for example, a participant drops out of a study, a machine fails, someone skips a survey question, or a recording error is made.

Missing data are usually shown as an empty cell, a $.$ (dot), or a $*$ (asterisk). Invalid entries -- like text in a numeric column or a `N/A` error -- are also treated as missing.

::: callout-caution
Sometimes older datasets use numbers like $99999$ to mark missing data. In such cases, replace them with a proper missing value indicator before analysis.

::: callout-tip
The missing values can take the form of blank cells, null values or special symbols like `NA`, `NaN` or "*unknown*"

## Importance of Handling Missing Values

Handeling missing values is essential for accurate and reliable analysis. Key reasons include:
- **Better Model Accuracy**: Fixing missing data improves predictions and model performance.
- **Maintained Sample Size**: Imputation or careful removal keeps more data available for analysis.
- **Reduced Bias**: Proper handeling prevents distorted or misleading results. 
- **Stronger Decisions**: Clean data leads to more confident and trustworthy conclusions. 

## Challenges Caused by Missing Values

Missing data can create problems such as 
- **Smaller Sample Size**: Removing rows with missing values reduces data and reliability. 
- **Biased Results**: Non-random missing data can lead to false conclusions. 
- **Limited Analysis**: Many methods can not handle missing data, restricting analysis options. 

## Common Reasons for Missing Data

Data may be missing due to:
- **Technical issues**: Equipment failure or data transfer errors.
- **Human errors**: Mistakes in entry or recording.
- **Privacy concerns**: Withholding sensitice information. 
- **Processing problems**: Errors during data preparation or transformation.

## Figure out Why the Data Is Missing

Before handling missing values, it is IMPORTANT to understand why they are missing -- this is part of what we can call **data intuition**, or the ability to look closely at your data and reason about what is happening.

Ask yourself this key question:

** Is the value missing because it was recorded, or because it does not exist?**

- If it **does not exist** (for example, the height of the oldest child of someone who does not have any children), it does not make sense to fill it in -- keep it as `NaN`.
- If it **was not recorded** (for example, a measurement that someone forgot to take), you may estimate it using other available data. This process is called **imputation**.

Undertanding the reason behind missing values you decide whether to *leave them as missing* or *fill them in intelligently*.
