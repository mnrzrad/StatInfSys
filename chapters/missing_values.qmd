# Missing Values

Missing values happen when data for an observation is not recorded. This can occur if, for example, a participant drops out of a study, a machine fails, someone skips a survey question, or a recording error is made.

Missing data are usually shown as an empty cell, a $.$ (dot), or a $*$ (asterisk). Invalid entries -- like text in a numeric column or a `N/A` error -- are also treated as missing.

::: callout-caution
Sometimes older datasets use numbers like $99999$ to mark missing data. In such cases, replace them with a proper missing value indicator before analysis.

::: callout-tip
The missing values can take the form of blank cells, null values or special symbols like `NA`, `NaN` or "*unknown*"

## Importance of Handling Missing Values

Handeling missing values is essential for accurate and reliable analysis. Key reasons include:

- **Better Model Accuracy**: Fixing missing data improves predictions and model performance.
  
- **Maintained Sample Size**: Imputation or careful removal keeps more data available for analysis.
  
- **Reduced Bias**: Proper handeling prevents distorted or misleading results. 
  
- **Stronger Decisions**: Clean data leads to more confident and trustworthy conclusions. 

## Challenges Caused by Missing Values

Missing data can create problems such as 
- **Smaller Sample Size**: Removing rows with missing values reduces data and reliability. 
  
- **Biased Results**: Non-random missing data can lead to false conclusions. 
  
- **Limited Analysis**: Many methods can not handle missing data, restricting analysis options. 

## Common Reasons for Missing Data

Data may be missing due to:
- **Technical issues**: Equipment failure or data transfer errors.
  
- **Human errors**: Mistakes in entry or recording.
  
- **Privacy concerns**: Withholding sensitice information. 

- **Processing problems**: Errors during data preparation or transformation.

## Figure out Why the Data Is Missing

Before handling missing values, it is IMPORTANT to understand why they are missing -- this is part of what we can call **data intuition**, or the ability to look closely at your data and reason about what is happening.

Ask yourself this key question:

** Is the value missing because it was recorded, or because it does not exist?**

- If it **does not exist** (for example, the height of the oldest child of someone who does not have any children), it does not make sense to fill it in -- keep it as `NaN`.
  
- If it **was not recorded** (for example, a measurement that someone forgot to take), you may estimate it using other available data. This process is called **imputation**.

Undertanding the reason behind missing values you decide whether to *leave them as missing* or *fill them in intelligently*.


## Example Dataset

Let us start with an example, the `airquality` dataset, which records daily air quality measurements in New York (1973). 
```{webr-r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| autorun: true
#| out-width: 80%

data("airquality")

summary(airquality)
```
It has missing values in `Ozone` and `Solar.R` columns.

There are some libraries that can help us visualize missing data patterns, such as `naniar`, `VIM`, and `mice`

```{webr-r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| autorun: true
#| out-width: 80%

# Install (if needed)
# install.packages("naniar")

library(naniar)

# Proportion of missing values
prop_miss(airquality)

# Count missing values per column
miss_var_summary(airquality)

# Visualize missingness
vis_miss(airquality)

# Bar plot of missing values per variable
gg_miss_var(airquality)
```

```{r}
#| autorun: true
#| out-width: 80%
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Install (if needed)
# install.packages("VIM")
library(VIM)

# Aggregation plot of missingness
aggr(airquality, numbers = TRUE, sortVars = TRUE)
```

```{webr-r}
#| autorun: true
#| out-width: 80%
#| warning: false
#| message: false
library(mice)

md.pattern(airquality)
```

## Types of Missing Data
Sometimes, we expect a value in our dataset, but it is not there. For example, a survey respondent may skip a question, or a sensor may fail to record a measurement, or a file got lost. These are missing values. But **not all missing values happen for the same reason** -- and the reason matters, because it affects how we should handle them.

1. **Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)**: The missingness is entirely random and unrelated to any other data. 

Think of this as:

> *The data went missing by accident.*
