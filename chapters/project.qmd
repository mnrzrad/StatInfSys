# Project

## Exercise 1

Please copy this R code into your computer and try to solve it.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
download.file(
  url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mnrzrad/SIE/main/exercises/Exercise_EDA.Rmd",
  destfile = "Exercise_EDA.Rmd",
  method = "curl"
)
```

This code saves the file into your current working directory.

After, chech where the file was saved using the code

```{r, eval=FALSE}
getwd()

```

This code tells you the working directory (the folder where R is looking and saving files).

Then, you can list files in that folder to confirm.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
list.files()
```

Now, open it in R studio.

- In RStudio, go to **File** → **Open File**

- Navigate to the folder shown by **getwd()**

- Select Exercise_EDA.Rmd → *Open*
