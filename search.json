    "text": "1.1 What is the Ethics of Data Science?\nThe ethics of data science are very important, and all data analyst, data scientists, and everyone who works with data should know the principles of ethics.\nAll individuals handling data are obligated to report any occurrences such as data theft, improper storage, unethical data collection, or data misuse.\nFor example, a business might track and store information about a customer’s path, starting from the moment they enter their email address on the website until they purchase products. In such cases, it is essential that the individual’s report remains confidential and is safeguarded it from unauthorized access.\nThe study and evaluation of ethical issues related to data have led to the emergence of a new domain in ethics, known as “data science ethics.” Data can be collected, recorded, generated, processed, shared, and used. This field also covers various data and technologies, including programming, professional code, and algorithms.\nIn the past, ethical principles in computer and information science primarily focused on the content and information present within computer systems. However, with the advancement of technology and the increasing volume of data, the scope of data science ethics has expanded to include concepts and principles related to data collection, use, processing, and sharing.\nWhen companies collect data from individuals, ethical issues related to privacy, personal information, and data misuse arise. However, when companies begin to use these data for purposes not initially specified, even more ethical concerns emerge. In other words, companies try to monetize the collected data, using it in ways that were not previously disclosed. This practice further challenges privacy, trust, and ethics in data collection and use.\nAlthough “ethics” seems complicated, it is really about understanding what is right or wrong. There are different ways people think about ethics, especially when it comes to data world.",

    "text": "Important\n\n\n\nData Ethics covers the moral and ethical obligations related to the collection, sharing, and use of data, focusing on ensuring its fair and beneficial applications. It is mainly focused on any negative impacts that data might have on individuals, groups or wider society.\n\n\n\n1.1.1 Principles of Data Ethics for Business Professionals\nIn an era where data is considered the new oil, understanding the ethical issues related to its collection, analysis, and use is of most important. Below, we will introduce the five key ethical principles that every data professional should be aware of.\n\nOwnership: The first principle of data ethics is that every individual has the right to ownership over their personal information. Just as it is considered theft to take an object without its owner’s permission, collecting someone’s personal information without their consent is both illegal and unethical. Some common methods for obtaining consent include signed written agreements, digital privacy policies that require users to agree to a company’s terms and conditions, and pop-up windows with check-boxes that allow websites to track users’ online behavior with cookies. *Never assume customers agree to their information being collected; always seek their permission to avoid ethical and legal problems.\nTransparency: In addition to ownership, individuals whose data you collect have the right to know how you plan to gather, store, and use their personal information. When collecting data, prioritize transparency and provide them with all necessary information.\nFor example, imagine your company decides to implement an algorithm to personalize the website experience based on user shopping habits and behavior. You should develop a policy explaining that cookies will track user behavior, the collected data will be stored in a secure database, and an algorithm will be trained to personalize the website experience.\nUsers have the right to access this information so they can decide whether to accept or reject your website’s cookies. Hiding or lying about your company’s methods and goals is deceptive, illegal, and unfair to the individuals whose data you handle.\nPrivacy: One of the ethical responsibilities associated with handling data is preserving the privacy of individuals whose data is involved. Even if a customer has given your company permission to collect, store, and analyze their Personally Identifiable Information (PII), it does not mean they want this information to be publicly accessible.\nPII is any data that relates to an individual’s identity. This typically includes items such as full name, address, phone number, date of birth, credit card number, bank account number, social security number, passport number, and other information that can be used to identify a person.\nTo protect individuals’ privacy, ensure you store data in a secure database to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. Data security methods that help maintain privacy include file encryption (transforming information into a readable format only with an encryption key) and dual-authentication (password protection with two-factor authentication).\nOne way to prevent errors is to de-identify the dataset. When all PII is removed, only anonymous data remains, and the dataset can no longer be traced back to individuals. This allows analysis to identify relationships between variables of interest without linking data points to personal identities.\nIntention : Before you even begin collecting data, it is crucial to consider why you need this data and what purpose you aim to achieve with it. If your intention is to engage in unethical activities, such as harassing others or improperly exploiting individuals’ vulnerabilities, then collecting their data is not ethical. Ethical data collection requires a legitimate purpose and operating in accordance with regulations and ethical principles.\nEven when your intention is good - for instance, collecting data to understand health experience in order to create an app that addresses urgent needs – you still need to evaluate your purpose for collecting every piece of data.\nOutcomes : Even if your intention and purpose in collecting and analyzing data are good, the outcome of this process might unintentionally cause harm to individuals or groups. This type of harm is known as disparate impact and is considered invalid under civil rights laws, meaning it is illegal.\nUnfortunately, you cannot definitively predict the exact impact of data analysis until it is complete. However, by considering this question and its importance before conducting the analysis, you can identify any potential disparate impacts that might occur. By being aware if the possibility of disparate impact, you can then take the necessary steps to prevent and mitigate it.",

    "text": "1.2 Why is Ethics Important in the Age of Data Abundance?\nUsing information ethically within decision-making has always been important. However, two factors have made data ethics business-critical:\n\nData Volumes : There has been an explosion in the amount of data available to organizations, both collected themselves, ans sourced from third-parties. It is not always clear where this information has come from, particularly in the case of personal information, and what permissions have been provided for its reuse.\nArtificial Intelligence : Organizations are increasing using machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to make sense of data and take automated decisions based on data analysis without involving human oversights. This can lead to issues around fairness and discrimination, even if these are unintended consequences of how data is used.\n\nThe importance of ethics in data science stems from the necessity of having a clear set of rules and guidelines that determine what businesses can and cannot do with the personal information they collect from their customers. This is crucial for safeguarding customer privacy and rights, and appropriate laws and standards must be established to protect personal information.\nAll experts agree that certain fundamental principles must be implemented, even if this field still contains gray areas and nothing is simple or uniform. These are just a few important topics and strategic ideas that have currently garnered the most attention. However, there is still much ground to cover in data ethics, and further progress and development are needed in this area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise 1\n\n\n\nIdentify the data ethics principle related to each question:\n\nIs it clear what data is being used for, how and where it is being stored, and is this information freely available to all?\nAre you collecting only data that is necessary and relevant to your clearly defined goals?\nHave you anticipated any potential harmful, negative, or biased impacts that could result from your use of the data?\nIs any personal or identifiable data being securely stored and anonymized to prevent unauthorized access?\nHave you obtained informed consent from individuals for how their data will be used in your project?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Answers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransparency\nIntention\nOutcomes\nPrivacy\nOwnership\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise 2\n\n\n\nIdentify the data ethics principle related to each question:\n\nA company collects location data from users’ mobile phones but does not disclose that this information will be shared with advertisers.\nAn analyst stores survey responses on an unsecured shared drive, and the file includes names and phone numbers of participants.\nA data science team begins using a health dataset for a study unrelated to the one participants originally agreed to take part in.\nBefore collecting any data, a team carefully evaluates whether the data they plan to gather is essential to their project goals and excludes anything not directly needed.\nBefore launching a new app feature based on user behavior data, a team conducts a risk assessment to explore how it might negatively affect vulnerable users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Answers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransparency\nPrivacy\nOwnership\nIntention\nOutcomes",

    "text": "2.1 Filter observations - filter()\nThe dplyr package is a part of the R tidyverse : an ecosystem of several libraries designed to work together by representing data in common formats.\nThe data frame is a key data structure in statistics and in R. The basic structure of a data frame is that there is one observation per ro and each column represents a variable, a measure, feature, or characteristic of that observation. Given the importance of managing data frames, it is important that we have good tools for dealing with them.\nThe dplyr package is a relatively new R package that allows you to do all kinds of analyses quickly and easily.\nOne important contribution of the dplyr package is that it provides a “grammar” (in particular, verbs) for data manipulating and for operating on data frames. With this grammar, you can sensibly communicate what it is that you are doing to a data frame that other people can understand (assuming they also know the grammar). This is useful because it provides an abstraction for data manipulation that previously did not exist.\nSome of the key “verbs” provided by the dplyr package are\nTo install the dplyr package from CRAN, just run\nAfter installing the package, it is important to load it into the R session.\nTo better understanding, let us continue within analyzing a dataset, penguins, available within the palmerpenguins package. we need to load the dataset and if it is necessary, we need to install the package.\n‌The data frame contain data for \\(344\\) penguins and \\(8\\) variables describing the species (species), the island (island), some measurements of the size of the bill (bill_length_mm and bill_depth_mm), flipper (flipper_length_mm) and body mass (body_mass_g), the sex (sex) and the study year (year). More information about the data frame can be found by running ?penguins .\nYou can see some basic characteristics of the dataset with the dim() and str() functions.\nThe first and last 6 rows can be displayed by head() and tail(), respectively.\nThe summary information of data frame can be found by summary() .\nThis function works on both quantitative and qualitative variables.\nYou can combine multiple conditions using & if all conditions must be true (cumulative), or | if at least one condition must be true (alternative). For example,\nAs you can see, the filter() functions require the name of the data frames as the first argument, then the condition (with the usual logical operators &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, ==, !=, %in%, etc.) as second argument.\nSo with the pipe operator, the code above becomes:\nInstead of listing the data frame’s name as the initial argument within functions like filter() (or other {dplyr} functions), you simply specify the data frame once, then use the pipe operator to connect it to the desired function.",

It takes three arguments:\n\nThe condition (e.g., body_mass_g &gt;= 4000).\nThe output value if the condition is TRUE (e.g., “High”).\nThe output value if the condition is FALSE (e.g., “Low”).\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA key advantage is that if_else() propagates missing values (NA) if the condition’s input is missing, preventing misclassification.\n\n\n\n\n2.15.2 Case When\nFor categorizing a variable into more than two levels, case_when() is far more appropriate and readable than nested if_else() statements.\nWhile nested if_else() functions can technically work, they are prone to errors and result in difficult-to-read code. For instance, to classify body mass into “Low” (&lt;3500), “High” (&gt;4750), and “Medium” (otherwise), nested if_else() would look like this:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis code first checks if body_mass_g is less than 3500. If true, it assigns “Low”. If false, it then checks if body_mass_g is greater than 4750. If that’s true, it assigns “High”; otherwise, it assigns “Medium”. While functional, this structure can become complex and error-prone with more conditions.\ncase_when() evaluates conditions sequentially. To improve this workflow, we now use the case when technique:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis workflow is much simpler to code and read!\nIf there are no missing values in the variable(s) used for the condition(s), it can even be simplified to:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhile a .default argument can be used to specify an output for observations not matching any condition, exercise caution with missing values.

A safer approach is to explicitly define all categories or ensure NAs remain NA.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRegardless of whether you use if_else() or case_when(), it’s always good practice to verify the newly created variable to ensure it aligns with your intended results.",

It allows you to `speak’ a graph from composable elements, instead of being limited to a predefined set of charts.\nBefore using ggplot2, a user must first install the package and then load it into their R session. Installation is done only using the command install.packages('ggplot2'). Alternatively, the following code can be used to install if only if the package is not already installed on the computer.\nwhich downloads the package from CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network). After installation, the package needs to be loaded each time R is restarted. This is done with the following command:\nA brief overview about using this package is available at this website and more complete information about how to use ggplot2 can be found in Wickham, Navarro, and Pederson (2019).\nThe structure of the package includes 7 composable parts that come together as a set of instructions on how to draw a chart.\nThe package ggplot2 requires a minimum of three main components to create a chart: data, mapping, and a layer. Other components – like scales, facets, coordinates, and themes – are optional because ggplot2 gives them automatic settings that usually work well, so you do not need to adjust them too much.\nIn the following, we briefly describe these components:\nEvery plot made with ggplot2 starts with data. This data should be in a tidy format that means the data is in a table (called a rectangular data frame) where:\nThe first step to create a plot with ggplot2 is to pass this data to the ggplot() function, which stores the data to be used later by other parts of the plot.\nFor example, if we want to make a plot using the mpg dataset, we begin like this:",

Since then, its importance has grown significantly, especially in recent years, for several key reasons: i) data is being produced faster and in larger volumes than ever before, ii) modern computing and software tools make it easier to explore, clean, and visualize data in meaningful ways, iii) contemporary statistical models are often complex and assumption-dependent, requiring us to thoroughly understand the data before applying formal techniques.

    "text": "Important\n\n\n\nThe EDA is important because it helps researchers make thoughtful decisions about which ideas are worth exploring. Sometimes, the data clearly show that a particular question does not have enough support to be studied further—at least not with the current evidence.\n\n\n\n\nTo suggest hypotheses about what might be causing the patterns or relationships observed in the data,\nTo guide the choice of appropriate statistical tools or models by helping you understand the structure of the data,\nTo assess key assumptions that must be checked before applying formal statistical analysis (e.g., linearity, normality, independence),\nTo provide a basis for further data collection, by highlighting gaps, inconsistencies, or areas where more information is needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nEDA is not typically the final stage of analysis. Rather, it serves as a transitional step between raw data and formal modeling. The insights gained through EDA guide decisions about which models to use, which variables to consider, and which data issues to address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDA Checklist\n\n\n\nRoger D. Peng in his book (Peng 2012) provide this checklist for conducting EDA.\n\nStart with a clear question: Before you begin EDA, take time to define exactly what you want to find out. A clear question or hypothesis gives your analysis purpose and helps you stay focused along the way.\nLoad your data carefully: Make sure your dataset is fully and correctly loaded into your analysis tool (e.g., R or Python). This first step is essential—it sets the stage for everything you will do next.\nTake a first look at the data: Check that the file type, structure, and layout are what you expected. Make sure everything is organized in a way that works for your analysis.\nUse str() to Peek Inside the Dataset: In R, it will get a quick summary: number of observations (rows), number and names of variables (columns), variable types (e.g., numeric, character, factor), and a preview of the data values\nLook at the Beginning and End of Your Data: Use functions such as head() and tail() to view the first and last few rows. This visual check can help to detect issues such as incorrect headers, blank rows, or unusual formatting.\nCheck the Number of Rows (“n”): Make sure to verify how many observations (rows) are in your dataset. Compare this to what you expected from the original. source. If the number is too high or too low, there may be missing values, duplicate entries, or extra rows (e.g. duplicates or blank lines).\nValidate with an External Source: When possible, compare part of your dataset with a trusted external source, such as official statistics or published reports. This helps confirm the accuracy and reliability of your data.\nTry the Simple Solution First: Start by basic methods–such as summaries, tables, or visualizations– to explore and answer your question. Simple tools can often reveal key patterns or issues. Use more complex techniques only of necessary.\nChallenge Your Findings: Once you find a result, pause and ask yourself: Does this make sense? Check your assumptions and consider possible errors or missing information. Being critical helps make your results stronger and more trustworthy.\nDecide What to Do Next: Use the insights from your EDA to guide your next steps. You may decide to collect more data, use new methods, or refine your question. Sometimes , your initial findings are already enough to answer your main question.\n\nIn Chapter 4 of Midway (2022), interested reader can find some comments for each step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nEDA is the single most important task to conduct at the beginning of every data science project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nEDA is like exploring a new place – you do not know what you will find until you start looking.\n\n\n\n4.1.1 Airquailty dataset\nWe will explore the airquality dataset, which contains daily measurement of air pollutants and weather conditions in New York City May to September 1973.\nStep 1 – How do ozone levels vary across different months in New York during the summer in 1973?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis question is specific and focused: One location (New York), One variable (ozone), one year and a defined time window (May to September)\n\n\nStep 2 – The airquality dataset is built into R.

Let visualize it:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nBased on the plot, we observe that July and August have the highest median ozone levels, showing that typical ozone concentrations were significantly higher during mid-summer. This suggests a seasonal pattern, likely driven by higher temperatures and increased sunlight, which promote the formation of ozone. The taller boxes and whiskers for these months reflect a greater variability in ozone levels, including several high outliers. In contrast, May and September show lower median values and less variation, possibly due to cooler temperatures and different atmospheric conditions. The median ozone level is June is slightly higher than in May but lower than in July, with a moderate level of variability. Overall, this seasonal trend is consistent with environmental science – ozone forms more easily in strong sunlight and warm conditions, which are more prevalent in July and August.\nStep 9 – Let us examine whether temperature or wind speed might help explain ozone patterns.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou may observe that there is a positive relationship between temperature and ozone and a negative relationship between wind speed and ozone. These patterns support common environmental science findings.\nStep 10 – Based on our findings, we might fit a simple regression model\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe might also refine our question: On which days was the ozone level unusually high, and what were the weather conditions on those days?\n\n4.1.1.1 Alternative question\nStep 1 – Which weather factor—temperature, wind, or solar radiation—has the strongest relationship with ozone levels during the summer of 1973 in New York?\nThis question is more analytical than descriptive, and focused on relationships between variables.

    "section": "4.2 Principles of Analytic Graphics",
    "text": "4.2 Principles of Analytic Graphics\nBased on (Tufte 2006), there are six key principles for designing informative and effective graphs.\n\n4.2.1 Principle 1 – Show Comparison\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShowing comparisons is really the basis of all good scientific investigation. (Peng 2012)\n\n\n\nGood data analysis always involves comparing things. A single number or result doesn’t mean much on its own. We need to ask:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to what?\n\n\n\nFor example, if we see that children with air cleaners had more symptom-free days, that sounds good. But how do we know the air cleaner made the difference? We only know that by comparing to another group of children who didn’t get the air cleaner. When we add that comparison, we can see that the control group didn’t improve — so the improvement likely came from the air cleaner.\n\n\n\nChange in symptom-free days with air cleaner. Source: @Peng2012\n\n\n\n\n\nChange in symptom-free days with air cleaner. Source: @Peng2012\n\n\n\n\n\nChange in symptom-free days by treatment group. Source: @Peng2012\n\n\nGood data graphics should always show at least two things so we can compare and understand what’s really happening.\n\n\n4.2.2 Principle 2: Show Causality and Explanation\nWhen making a data graphics, it is helpful to show why you think something is happening – not just what is happening. Even if you can not prove a cause, you can show your hypothesis of idea about how one thing might lead to another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf possible, it is always useful to show your causal framework for thinking about a question. (Peng 2012)\n\n\n\n\nFor example, in #figEDA2 we saw that children with an air cleaner had more symptom–free days. But that alone does not explain why. A good follow-up question is: “Why did the air cleaner help?“ One possible reason is that air cleaners reduce fine particles in the air – especially in homes with smokers. Breathing in these particles can make asthma worse, so removing them might help children feel better. To show this, we can make a new plot.\n\n\n\nChange in symptom-free days and change in PM2.5 levels in-home. Source: Peng (2012)\n\n\nFrom the plot, we can see:\n\nChildren with air cleaners had more symptom-free days.\nTheir homes also had less PM2.5 after six months.\nIn contrast, the control group had little improvement.\n\nThis pattern supports the idea that air cleaners work by reducing harmful particles — but it is not final proof. Other things might also cause the change, so more data and careful studies are needed to confirm.\n\n\n4.2.3 Principle 3: Show Multivariate Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe real world is multivariate. (Peng 2012)\n\n\n\nIn real life, most problems involve more than one or two variables. We call this multivariate data. Good data graphics should try to show these multiple variables at the same time, instead of reducing everything to just one number or a simple trend.\nLet us look at an example.\nThe mtcars dataset contains information about 32 car models from the 1970s. Each row is a car and each column is a variable. Some of these variables are: mpg: miles per gallon (fuel efficiency), wt: weight (in 1000 lbs), cyl: number of cylanders (engine size), hp: horse power, qsec: 1/4 mile time (acceleration), am: Transmission (0 = auto, 1 = manual). These variables help us to explore relationship between engin size, weight, fuel use, and more.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe want to know how a car’s weight affects its fuel efficiency (miles per gallon). We look at a simple scatter plot of these two variables.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHeavier cars tend to have lower fuel efficiency. But is weight the only thing affecting fuel use?\nCars also have different engine sizes, measured by cylinders (cyl). This affects both weight and fuel efficiency. To understand the relationship better, we add cyl as a third variable by coloring points by the number of cylinders.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNow, we see that cars with 4, 6, and 8 cylinders have different trends. The overall pattern changes once we include this third variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThe number of cylinders cofounds the relationship – it influences both weight and MPG.\n\n\nTo understand how the number of cylinders changes the relationship between weight and fuel efficiency, we can make separate plots for each cylinder group. This is called faceting.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSometimes, looking at groups separately helps us find clearer patterns that get lost in a big mixed dataset.\n\n\nEven, we can add the variable transmission(am) as an additional variable by using shapes or facet.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNow, each panel shows either automatic automatic or manual cars. Within each panel, colors show the number of cylinders.\nEven we can use facet_grid that allows us to split the plot into rows and columns based on two categorical variables – perfect for showing how relationships vary across combinations. We will use am in rows and cyl in columns.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis way, we can see how the relationship between weight and MPG changes in each group combination.\n\n\n4.2.4 Principle 4: Integrate Evidence — Keep the message clear\nWhen you make a graph, do not rely on points and lines to show your idea. You can also use: Numbers to give exact values, Words or short labels to explain what is happening, Pictures or diagrams to give context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nA good graph tells a complete story.\n\n\nUse all tools you need – not just the ones your software gives you easily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe goal is not to just make a nice picture, but to help people understand your message clearly.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.5 Principle 5: Describe and Document the Evidence\nA good graph tells a story – clearly and completely. That means it should include:\n\nA clear title\nLabels for the x-axis and y-axis\nUnits for measurement (e.g. ‘weights in 1000 lbs’)\nTime scale if needed (e.g. ‘daily’, ‘monthly’)\nwhere the data comes from (e.g., ‘New York’, ‘EPA’)\nsource of the data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nImagine someone looking only at your plot without reading anything else.

    "text": "4.3 Enter the world of EDA\nEDA is the process of looking at data to understand it before using statistics or models. It helps us to answer questions like: - what types of data do we have? - Are there missing or strange values? - What patterns can we see? - What kind of summary or visualization is helpful?\nBefore we start any analysis, we must know what kind of data we are working with. Variables can be broadly divided into numeric and categorical types.\n\n4.3.1 Types of Variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nKnowing the types of data matters because:\n\nDifferent statistics method are used for different variable types.\nSome graphs are only useful for some types of variables.\n\n\n\n\n4.3.1.1 Numerical variables\nNumeric variables describe quantities that we can measure — they answer questions like “how many?” or “how much?”. These variables are also called quantitative variables, and the data they produce are known as quantitative data. Briefly, they are numbers that can be measured. Also, we can do math with them.\n\n4.3.1.1.1 Continuous vs. Discrete\nNumeric variables can be:\nContinuous\n\nCan take any value on a number line, including decimals.\nRepresent real-world quantities.\n\nSome examples are: mass, age, temperature, time.\nContinuous variables can be positive only (like mass) or positive and negative (like change in temperature).\nDiscrete\n\nCan take only whole number values (no decimals).\nBased on counting.\n\nSome examples are: number of students, number of offspring, number of infected individuals\nA discrete variable cannot take values between integers — e.g., it makes no sense to have 2.5 individuals.\n\n\n4.3.1.1.2 Ratio vs. Interval\nNumeric variables can be further described based on the scale they are measured on: ratio or interval. This affects how we can interpret differences, proportions, and calculations.\nRatio\n\nHas a true zero point (zero means “none”).\nAllows all mathematical operations, including ratios.\n\nSome examples are: Height, Weight, Age, Income, mass.\nYou can say: “Tree A is twice as tall as Tree B.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we can do:\n\n\n\n\nAll descriptive statistics\nUse histograms, box-plots, scatterplots\n\n\n\nInterval\n\nHas no true zero — the zero point is arbitrary.\nAllows meaningful differences, but not ratios.\n\nSome examples are Temperature (in Celsius of Fahrenheit), IQ scores, Calendar dates (e.g. year 1000 vs 2000)\nYou can say: “The difference between 20°C and 10°C is 10 degrees.” But not: “20°C is twice as hot as 10°C.”\n\n4.3.1.1.2.1 What we can do:\n\ncalculate mean, standard deviation\nplot histograms or line charts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThe difference between ratio and interval is about how the variable is measured, not what is being measured.\nFor example, Temperature can be measured on:\n\nThe Celsius scale that results in an interval scale (no true zero).\nThe Kelvin scale that results in a ratio scale (zero means no temperature, i.e. absolute zero).\n\nSo, the same thing (temperature) can be: an interval variable (in °C), or a ratio variable (in K), depending on the scale we use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.1.2 Categorical Variables\nCategorical variables describe qualities or characteristics. They answer questions like “what type?” or “which group?”. These are also known as qualitative variables, and the data they produce are qualitative data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nCategorical variables do not have numeric meaning (even if coded as numbers!).\n\n\nCategorical variables fall into two groups:\nNominal Variables\n\nCategories have no logical order.\nOnly show labels or names.\n\nFor example, Gender (male, female), Blood group (A, B, AB, O), City (Lisbon, Porto, Faro, … ), color (red, blue, green)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we can do:\n\n\n\n\nCount frequencies (e.g. how many students are from each city)\nUse bar charts or pie charts\n\n\n\nOrdinal Variables\n\nCategories can be ordered or ranked.\nBut the distance between categories is not exact.\n\nFor example, Satisfaction (low, medium, high), education (primary, secondary, university), rank (1st, 2nd, 3rd), Academic grades (A, B, C)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we can do:\n\n\n\n\nCount frequencies\nCompare medians\nUse bar charts or ordered plots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nDo not use numbers to label categories.\nEven though categories can be coded as numbers (e.g., Male = 1, Female = 2), this can be confusing. It may suggest an order or imply mathematical operations that don’t make sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: Use text labels like \"Male\" and \"Female\" instead of 1 and 2.\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Variable Types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Type\nScale\nOrdered?\nCan Measure Distance?\nCan Divide?\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nNominal\nCategorical\n❌ No\n❌ No\n❌ No\nGender, City, Color\n\n\nOrdinal\nCategorical\n✅ Yes\n❌ No (not exact)\n❌ No\nRank, Education, Likert\n\n\nInterval\nNumeric\n✅ Yes\n✅ Yes\n❌ No\nTemperature, Year\n\n\nRatio\nNumeric\n✅ Yes\n✅ Yes\n✅ Yes\nAge, Weight, Income\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you are not sure about a variable, ask:\n\nDoes the variable have a natural order?\nCan we count it or measure it?\nDoes it have a true zero?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMidway, Steve. 2022.
